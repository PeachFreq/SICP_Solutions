# SICP Solutions

My intention in taking this course is to follow-through on the advice from teachyourselfcs.com with regards to how to be a better programmer. SICP is a famous class on functional programming that was created at MIT. It is widely considered to be a pedagogical masterpiece, and thus I wanted the experience despite the fact that the course is almost 40 years old.
